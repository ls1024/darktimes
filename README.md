Watch face for Garmin fenix 3, D2 and fenix5 series

## Settings
### Colors
Background
Time/date in low power mode (LPM)
Time/date in high power mode
Battery warning
Bluetooth block
Alarm block
Notification block
Time period color

### Other
If LPM time/date is the same as the background color there is an option to
set a period in which the time is shown. I use it to get around the issue
with the backlight button not bringing the watch out of LPM.
Set the value when the battery warning color kicks in.
Something else I forgot about...

## In sleep mode
Does not show time with the default settings when the watch is in sleep mode.
Shows if connected to phone with square to the left.
Shows alarms set.
Shows notifications.

## When awake
Shows time, date and battery % as well.

## Issues
backlight doesn't bring watch face out of low power mode, crap.
